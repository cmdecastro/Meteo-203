# Meteorology 203 - Methods of Analytical Meteorology and Oceanography

### This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks and datasets I used and reported on for my graduate class in Methods of Analytical Meteorology and Oceanography.

Each folder corresponds to one activity, and contains different set of files:

### 1. DataSets
Some of the data were given to us by our professor, while some are obtained online. The websites where I obtained the data are indicated in accompanying Jupyter notebooks.

### 2. Jupyter notebook
Each activity folder contains one or more Jupyter notebookes containing the codes (in Python) I used for the activity. The notebooks also contained the plots and figures with accompanying short descriptions and interpretation of results that I presented in class. 

### 3. Activity Guide
The activity guide contains the instructions and references given to us by our professor to serve as our template for discussion in our codes.
